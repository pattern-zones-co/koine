            EVENT: ${{ github.event.action }}

            Before reviewing:
            1. Run `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comments` to read ALL existing comments on this PR
            2. Run `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see the current changes
            3. If this is a "synchronize" event (new commits pushed), focus ONLY on what changed since your last review

            Review guidelines:
            - Do NOT repeat feedback already given in prior comments (yours or others)
            - If issues from your last review were addressed, acknowledge briefly
            - If no new issues exist, do NOT leave a comment - just exit silently
            - Focus on: bugs, security issues, logic errors, and significant problems
            - Skip minor style nitpicks if the code follows CLAUDE.md conventions
            - Be concise - a few sentences is better than paragraphs

            If you have meaningful NEW feedback, use `gh pr comment` to post it.
            If prior feedback still applies and wasn't addressed, you may reference it briefly.
            If you have nothing new to add, exit without commenting.
